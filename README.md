**Artisan Deployer is the easiest way to deploy your Laravel applications.**

### Features

  * Zero dependencies. No Python. No Ruby. No Capistrano. No Ansible. Nothing.
  * Zero configuration files. No YAML. No XML. No JSON. Just pure PHP awesomeness.
  * Multi-server and multi-stage deployment (e.g. "production", "staging", "qa").
  * Zero downtime deployments.
  * Supports Laravel 5.x applications.
  * Compatible with GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab and your own Git servers.

> **NOTE**
> Artisan Deployer does not "provision" servers (like installing a web server and the
> right PHP version for your application); use Ansible if you need that.
> Artisan Deployer does not deploy containerized applications: use Kubernetes if you
> need that.
